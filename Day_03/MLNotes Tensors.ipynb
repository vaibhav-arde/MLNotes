    "#### **What is a Tensor?**\n",
    "- A tensor is a fundamental data structure in machine learning and deep learning. It is essentially a container for numbers, representing data in various dimensions. Tensors are a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Data Structure: Tensor**\n",
    "- **0D Tensor (Scalar)**: A single number or value. It has no dimensions and is also known as a scalar.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \\( x = 5 \\) (Here, \\( x \\) is a 0D tensor or scalar.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1D Tensor (Vector)**: An array or a sequence of numbers. It is a collection of scalars.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \\( v = [1, 2, 3] \\) (Here, \\( v \\) is a 1D tensor or vector.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dimensions of a Tensor**\n",
    "- The dimension of a tensor refers to the number of indices required to access a specific element within it. This is also referred to as the **Rank** of the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rank**: The number of dimensions or axes a tensor has.\n",
    "- **Axes**: The individual dimensions along which the data is arranged.\n",
    "- **Shape**: The size of each axis or dimension in the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Axes = Rank = Number of Dimensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Vector and Its Types**\n",
    "- **Vector**: A vector is a collection of scalars. It is a 1D tensor.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \\( v = [1, 2, 3] \\) (This is a vector with three elements.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix**: A matrix is a collection of vectors arranged in rows and columns. It is a 2D tensor.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \n",
    "     M = \n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n",
    "    4 & 5 & 6\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    (Here, \\( M \\) is a 2D tensor or matrix.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ND Tensors (Higher-Dimensional Tensors)**\n",
    "- **1D Tensor**: A tensor with one dimension (vector).\n",
    "  - **Example**: \\( v = [1, 2, 3, 4] \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2D Tensor**: A tensor with two dimensions (matrix).\n",
    "  - **Example**: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    M = \n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n",
    "    4 & 5 & 6\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **3D Tensor**: A tensor with three dimensions. Used in applications like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time series data.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \n",
    "    T = \n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "    \n",
    "    (Here, \\( T \\) is a 3D tensor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4D Tensor**: A tensor with four dimensions. Commonly used for image data, where dimensions might represent the number of images, image height, image width, and color channels.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Consider a batch of 5 color images, each of size 28x28 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Shape = (5, 28, 28, 3)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (Here, it's a 4D tensor representing a batch of images.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5D Tensor**: A tensor with five dimensions. Typically used for video data, where dimensions might represent the number of videos, frames per video, image height, image width, and color channels.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Consider a batch of 3 videos, each containing 10 frames, with frame size 64x64 pixels and 3 color channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Shape = (3, 10, 64, 64, 3)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Summary of Tensors and Their Examples**:\n",
    "- **0D Tensor**: Scalar (e.g., x = 5 )\n",
