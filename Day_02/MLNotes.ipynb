    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent interacts with the environment, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its actions to achieve the best possible outcome over time.\n",

    "### Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "- **Agent**: The decision-maker or learner.\n",
    "- **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.\n",
    "- **State**: A representation of the current situation or status of the environment.\n",
    "- **Action**: The decisions or moves the agent can make.\n",
    "- **Reward**: The feedback the agent receives after taking an action, indicating the success of that action.\n",
    "- **Policy**: The strategy that the agent uses to decide which action to take in a given state.\n",

    "1. **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: In model-based RL, the agent builds or is provided with a model of the environment. This model includes information about how the environment responds to different actions (i.e., transition probabilities) and the rewards associated with those actions.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: The agent uses this model to simulate outcomes and plan actions ahead of time, optimizing its decisions based on predicted future states and rewards.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Model-Free Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: In model-free RL, the agent does not build a model of the environment. Instead, it learns a policy directly from experience by interacting with the environment and observing the outcomes of its actions.\n",

    "     - **Value-Based Methods**:\n",
    "       - **Definition**: These methods focus on estimating the value of states or state-action pairs (how good it is to be in a particular state or take a particular action).\n",
    "       - **Common Algorithm**: **Q-Learning**: The agent learns a value function (Q-value) that estimates the expected reward for taking an action in a given state and uses it to select actions that maximize the Q-value.\n",

    "       - **Common Algorithm**: **REINFORCE Algorithm**: The agent updates its policy based on the rewards obtained from following the policy, adjusting it to increase the likelihood of selecting actions that lead to higher rewards.\n",
    "       - **Example**: \n",
    "         - **Robotic Arm Movement**: A robotic arm learns to pick and place objects by optimizing the sequence of movements that results in successfully completing the task with minimal error.\n",
