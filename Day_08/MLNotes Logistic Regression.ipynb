    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used primarily for **classification problems**. Despite its name, logistic regression is not used for regression tasks but for binary and multiclass classification. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class, using a logistic (sigmoid) function to map predicted values to a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind logistic regression is to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target), where the target is categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for logistic regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = 1 / (1 + e^-(b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ))\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( p \\) is the predicted probability,\n",
    "- \\( b_0 \\) is the intercept (bias),\n",
    "- \\( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \\) are the coefficients (weights) for the input features \\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\),\n",
    "- \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm (Euler’s number).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A **classification problem** refers to a task where the goal is to assign a label from a predefined set of categories to input data. The output in classification is discrete (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam, class labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Classification Problems:\n",
    "1. **Binary Classification**: \n",
    "   - This is the simplest classification task, where the target variable has only **two possible classes**. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not (spam/non-spam).\n",
    "   - Logistic regression is frequently used for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Predicting if a patient has a disease (yes/no).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiclass Classification**:\n",
    "   - This involves **more than two classes**. The goal is to assign one class label from multiple possible categories.\n",
    "   - Logistic regression can be extended to handle multiclass classification using strategies like **one-vs-rest (OvR)** or **softmax regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Classifying types of fruit (apple/orange/banana).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sigmoid function** is a mathematical function used in logistic regression to map predicted values to probabilities. It has an \"S\" shaped curve and squashes input values to the range (0, 1). This is essential for binary classification tasks where you want to predict the probability of class membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the sigmoid function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( z \\) is the linear combination of input features and weights (i.e., the output from the linear part of logistic regression).\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma(z) \\) is the probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function helps in decision-making by setting a threshold (usually 0.5). If \\( \\sigma(z) > 0.5 \\), the model predicts one class (e.g., positive), otherwise it predicts the other class (e.g., negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm that predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function.\n",
    "- **Classification Problem**: A task of assigning input data to a set of predefined categories.\n",
    "- **Binary Classification**: Two possible output classes.\n",
    "- **Multiclass Classification**: More than two possible output classes.\n",
    "- **Sigmoid Function**: Maps any real-valued number into a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts form the basis of many classification tasks in machine learning."
